Kern test for characters in both halves of the virtual font:
w&#x014d;w should be w followed by omacron.

<?sdop kern="no"?>
<para>
This is a test paragraph where kerning should be turned off.
Yorkshire is a good test. Try also w&#x014d;w. At the end of
the paragraph, we'll turn kerning on again so it should happen
for the lines that follow.
</para>
<?sdop kern="yes"?>
<para>
Kerning should be back on again now. This paragraph should be
long enough so that the lines in it are justified. We want to be sure
that the spacing is worked out correctly.
Yorkshire is a good test. Try also w&#x014d;w. 
How does that look? Now try turning kerning off for just one word
in the middle of a paragraph.
<?sdop kern="no"?>Yorkshire,<?sdop kern="yes"?> Yorkshire. Extend this 
paragraph so that the line in which we did that is justified.

Yorkshire. This is the first line.
This is the second, <emphasis>with emphasized</emphasis> text.

This is the second first line.
This is the second second, <emphasis>with emphasized</emphasis> text.
Here is a third line.
The fourth line contains a Euro (&#x20ac;) and an unknown (&#xaaaa;) symbol.
The fifth line is going to be too long for the output so we'll make it quite a bit longer, longer, longer than the others.

<title>The finish of the flourishing fish</title>
<para>
OK, time for a ligature test. The finish of the flourishing fish. But don't 
ligaturize fixed pitch. <literal>The finish of the flourishing 
fish.</literal> And here's more text to fill out the line for yet another
check on the justification logic.
</para>
<para>
The last line of a paragraph is never right-justified unless is is very nearly
full already. We will add characters to the last line of this paragraph to 
check this this logic does work: a. a a a a a a a a a a a aa

Now we want to test out the use of hard spaces.
This&#xa0;next&#xa0;sentence&#xa0;uses&#xa0;only&#xa0;hard&#xa0;spaces.
