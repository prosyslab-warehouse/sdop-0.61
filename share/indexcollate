# This file contains the collating sequence for sorting entries when sdop is
# processing an index. The file lists characters in the order that is desired.
# Characters are separated by white space. A # sign signifies that the rest
# of the input line is comment which is ignored.

# If a whitespace-delimited item starts with =, the character is always given
# the same sort value as its predecessor. If it starts with + it is given the
# same sort value as its predecessor when sorting case-independently, but not
# when sorting is case-dependent.

# After removing a leading = or +, if an item consists of just one UTF-8
# character, it is interpreted as that character. Otherwise, it must be a
# hexadecimal number.

# Characters that are not listed in this file sort after those that are, 
# ordered by their code points.
