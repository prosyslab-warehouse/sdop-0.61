small.

Details are in the ChangeLog file.


Version 0.50
------------

Most of the elements of Simplified DocBook are either supported, or recognized
but ignored.


Version 0.03
------------

Many new processing instructions for changing font sizes, page sizes,
indentation, and support for colour.


Version 0.02
------------

 1. It is possible to change the main font familes for serif, sanserif, and
    monospaced fonts from the defaults of Times, Helvetica, and Courier, to any
    of the standard PostScript families.

 2. The index_headings processing instruction can be used to disable headings
    in indexes.

 3. There is support for <figure>s. There are some local processing
    instructions that control how they are processed:

    figure_number_format controls the format of figure numbers. It is a string
    that can contain up to two instances of "%s". If there is just one, the
    figure number, counting from the start of the document, is inserted. If
    there are two, the first is replaced by the chapter number, and the second
    by the figure number, counting from the start of the chapter. The default
    setting is "%s-%s". This is the string that will be replaced in references
    to the figure.

    figure_title_format controls the format of titles themselves. It is
    inserted before the text given in the <title> elelment. It may contain a
    single instance of "%s", which is is replaced by the figure number, in the
    format defined by figure_number_format. The default setting is the string
    "Figure %s: "

    figure_title_justify specifies whether titles are left, right, centre, or
    both justified.

    figure_title_width controls the width of titles. The default is to take the
    width of a <mediaobject> if available, otherwise the page width. The value
    may be an absolute dimension, or the word "object", signifying the default.

    If a figure contains a <mediaobject>, its alignment is taken as the
    figure's alignment. The title is positioned with relation to the figure.
    For example, if the figure is left aligned but the title is centred, it is
    centred with the figure, not with the page.

 4. There is support for <title> in <table>, with similar processing
    instructions for control to those provided for <figure>.

 5. There is support for <sect1>...<sect5> elements, but they are all treated
    as synonyms of <section>.

 6. There is support for <programlisting> as a synonym for <screen>.

 7. There is support for <![CDATA[...]]> literal text sections.

 8. There is support for <subscript> and <superscript>.



Version 0.01
------------

 1. The TOC is now omitted if it has no contents.

 2. The toc_sections processing instruction is now local rather than global.
    This means that its value can vary in different parts of the document.

 3. There is now support for <preface> elements, and there may be more than one
    preface. By default, sections in a preface are not numbered, nor are they
    included in the TOC. You can change both these actions by including a
    suitable processing instruction within the <preface> element. For example,
    to include preface sections in the TOC:

      <preface><title>Preface</title>
      <?sdop toc_sections="yes,yes"?>
      ...
      </preface>

    You could also put such an instruction before <preface>, but then it would
    also apply to the body of the document.

 4. There are now separate template files for headers and footers in the TOC,
    and also for the preface. Processing instructions for setting the special
    head/foot entities (such as &footleft) for the preface and the TOC are now
    provided.

 5. <appendix> and <colophon> are now supported. Appendices are lettered rather
    than numbered, controlled as if they were chapters for numbering and
    including in the TOC purposes. The first colophon is started on a new page,
    like a chapter, but subsequent ones are not. No headers or footers are
    output in colophons, and they are not included in the TOC.

 6. Up to nine <footnote>s per page are supported. If there are more than nine,
    the footnotes themselves will probably look all right, but the lines
    containing the references may be mis-formatted. It's a chicken-and-egg
    problem that I've decided isn't at present worth the effort of solving.

 7. Encapsulated PostScript and JPEG images are supported via <mediaobject>.

 8. There is support for "exotic" fonts.
